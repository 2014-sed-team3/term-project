To Build the NodeXL API Help File
---------------------------------

1. Build the NodeXL solution.  The help file depends on XML files built by
   Visual Studio at the same time it builds the solution.

2. Install the NDoc documentation tool.  See the NDoc Installation Notes below.

3. Check out $/NodeXL/Documents/Help/Api/NodeXLApi.chm.

4. On a command line, navigate to the local NodeXL directory corresponding to
   $/NodeXL/Documents/Help/Api and run this command:

       "[NDocPath]\NDocConsole.exe" -project=NodeXLApi.ndoc -verbose

   This creates a help file, NodeXLApi.chm, and puts it in the local directory
   corresponding to $/NodeXL/Documents/Help/Api.  It also creates a bunch of
   intermediate files in the same directory, all of which can be deleted.

5. As an alternative to step 4, you can run the NDoc GUI application at
   [NDocPath]\NDocGui.exe, open NodeXLApi.ndoc in the application, and run the
   Documentation, Build command.


NDoc Installation Notes
-----------------------

The latest official version of NDoc, 1.3.1, is available at
http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/.  However, version 1.3.1 does not work with the
generic classes introduced in .NET 2.0 and therefore doesn't work with NodeXL.

As of June 2007, NDoc is no longer under development, but before the NDoc
developer ended the project, he distributed an alpha version of NDoc 2.0.  The
alpha version does work with generics, and it's the one that should be used to
build the NodeXL help file.  It's checked into VSS at
$/Tools/NDoc/NDoc2-Alpha3u.zip.  There is no setup program; just unzip the Zip
file into any directory.  Included in this Zip file are the NDocConsole.exe and
NDocGui.exe programs referenced above.
