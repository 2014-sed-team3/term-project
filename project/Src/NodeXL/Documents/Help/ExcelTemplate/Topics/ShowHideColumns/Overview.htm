<div class="PageCaption">Showing and Hiding Workbook Columns</div>

<p>
<a href="../WorkbookTour/Worksheets.htm">NodeXL's worksheets</a> have many columns, some of which you may never use.  If you want to reduce worksheet clutter so you can concentrate on the columns that are important to you, you can tell NodeXL to hide some of the columns.
</p>

<p>
The columns are arranged in <span class="Definition">column groups</span>.  For example, the Edges worksheet includes Visual Properties, Label and Other column groups, and the Vertices worksheet includes the same column groups and several others.  (The Other column group is where you can add your own columns to the worksheet.)  NodeXL hides and shows workbook columns by column group.
</p>

<div class="HowToTitle">
To show or hide column groups:
</div>

<ol>

    <li class="HowToItem">
    In the Excel Ribbon, select NodeXL, Show/Hide, Workbook Columns.
    </li>

    <li class="HowToItem">
    Check the column groups you want to show and uncheck the column groups you want to hide.
    </li>

</ol>
