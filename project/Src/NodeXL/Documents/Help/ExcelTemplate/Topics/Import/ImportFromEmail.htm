<div class="PageCaption">Importing Graph Data from Email</div>

<p>
If you use a desktop-based email program such as Outlook, Windows Mail or Outlook Express on Windows 7 or Vista, you can tell NodeXL to analyze the relationships among the people you communicate with via email, and then import the results as graph data into the NodeXL workbook.  If you communicated 117 times with Bill via email, for example, the graph will include vertices for you and Bill, with a connecting edge that has an Edge Weight of 117.
</p>

<p>
NodeXL will not analyze Web-based email.

<p>
If you use Windows XP, you have to install <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/desktopsearch/default.mspx">Windows Search</a> before NodeXL will analyze your email.
