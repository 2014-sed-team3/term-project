<p>
A <span class="Definition">group</span> in NodeXL is a set of related vertices.  The vertices may be structurally related, meaning they are connected to one another in a certain way, or related by a common attribute&mdash;all vertices that represent people in Canada, for example.
</p>

<p>
Although groups are typically created in such a way that each vertex is in a group, this doesn't have to be the case.  You can have a graph where some vertices are in group A, some are in group B, and some are in no group at all, for example.  However, a vertex can never be in more than one group.
