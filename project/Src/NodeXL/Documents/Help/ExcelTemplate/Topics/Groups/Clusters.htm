<div class="PageCaption">Creating Groups by Cluster</div>

<p>
A cluster is a group of vertices that are densely connected to one another but sparsely connected to the rest of the graph.  NodeXL uses one of several mathematical algorithms to analyze the connection density and create a set of groups accordingly.

<div class="HowToTitle">
To remove any existing groups, create a group for each of the graph's clusters, and put every vertex in one of the new groups:

<ol>

    <li class="HowToItem">
    In the Excel Ribbon, select NodeXL, Analysis, Groups, Group by Cluster.
    </li>

    <li class="HowToItem">
    In the Group by Cluster dialog box, select a cluster algorithm to use.  The speed and effectiveness of the algorithms vary with the particular graph.  You may want to experiment with the algorithms to determine which you prefer.
    </li>

    <li class="HowToItem">
    Specify what you want to do with vertices that have no neighbors.
    </li>
