<p>
A connected component is a set of vertices (and their incident edges) that are connected to each other but not to the rest of the graph.  
</p>

<div class="HowToTitle">
To remove any existing groups, create a group for each of the graph's connected components, and put every vertex in one of the new groups:
</div>

<ol>

    <li class="HowToItem">
    In the Excel Ribbon, select NodeXL, Analysis, Groups, Group by Connected Component.
    </li>

    <li class="HowToItem">
    <a href="../SimpleGraph/Overview.htm#ShowGraph">Show the graph</a> to see the groups.
    </li>

</ol>

<p>
An isolate is a one-vertex connected component and is thus put into its own group.
