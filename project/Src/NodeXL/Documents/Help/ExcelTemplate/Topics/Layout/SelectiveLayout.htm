<p>
When you <a href="../SimpleGraph/Overview.htm#ShowGraph">show the graph</a>, NodeXL reads the workbook and lays out the graph using the selected <a href="LayoutAlgorithms.htm">layout algorithm</a>.  You can then lay out the entire graph again without rereading the workbook, which can save time when the workbook is large.  You can also lay out a subset of the graph's vertices.
</p>

<p>
Note that if you edit the workbook (to change a vertex color, for example), you must <a href="../SimpleGraph/Overview.htm#ShowGraph">refresh the graph</a> to get your edits to show up in the <a href="../WorkbookTour/GraphPane.htm">Graph Pane</a>.  If you don't want the graph to be laid out again when you refresh the graph, set the <a href="LayoutAlgorithms.htm">layout algorithm</a> to None.

To lay out a subset of the graph's vertices within their "bounding box" without rereading the workbook:

    In the layout menu at the top of the Graph Pane (<img class="VerticallyAlignedImage" src="../../Images/LayoutMenu.png" />), select Lay Out Selected Vertices Again, Within Bounds.  This keeps the selected vertices within the bounding box defined by the outermost selected vertices.
