<div class="PageCaption">The NodeXL Worksheets</div>

<p>
There are five worksheets built into a NodeXL workbook.  With a simple graph, the Edges worksheet may be the only one you work with.  The other worksheets offer customization options for more advanced scenarios.
</p>

<p>
The following table describes the NodeXL worksheets.
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
        Worksheet
        </th>
        <th>
        Description
        </th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>
        <a name="EdgesWorksheet"></a>
        Edges
        </td>
        <td>
        <p>
        Contains the graph's edges, which you specify as Vertex 1/Vertex 2 name pairs, along with optional edge attributes.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The vertex name pairs are the only columns in the entire workbook that are required.
        </p>
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>
        <a name="VerticesWorksheet"></a>
        Vertices
        </td>
        <td>
        <p>
        Contains the graph's vertices, along with optional vertex attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
        When you <a href="../SimpleGraph/Overview.htm#ShowGraph">show the graph</a>, NodeXL automatically creates a row in this worksheet for each vertex in the Edges worksheet.  The only vertices you have to enter manually are <a href="../Isolates/Overview.htm">isolated vertices</a> that are not connected to edges.  (You must set the Visibility cell for an isolated vertex to Show to get the vertex to show up in the Graph Pane.)  If your graph has no isolated vertices and you do not want to customize any vertices, you can ignore the Vertices worksheet.
        </p>
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>
        <a name="GroupsWorksheet"></a>
        Groups
        </td>
        <td>
        <p>
        Contains the names of the graph's groups, along with the groups'
        attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
        See <a href="../Groups/GroupWorksheets.htm">Understanding the Group Worksheets</a> for more information.  If your graph does not have groups, you can ignore the Groups worksheet.
        </p>
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>
        <a name="GroupVerticesWorksheet"></a>
        Group Vertices
        </td>
        <td>
        <p>
        Contains the names of the vertices in each of the graph's groups.
        </p>

        <p>
        See <a href="../Groups/GroupWorksheets.htm">Understanding the Group Worksheets</a> for more information.  You can usually ignore the Group Vertices worksheet, even if your graph has groups.
        </p>
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>
        <a name="OverallMetricsWorksheet"></a>
        Overall Metrics
        </td>
        <td>
        <p>
        Contains the graph's overall metrics, which you can calculate on
        demand.
        </p>

        <p>
        See <a href="../Analysis/GraphMetrics.htm">Calculating Graph Metrics</a> for more information.  If you do not calculate graph metrics, you can ignore the Overall Metrics worksheet.
        </p>
        </td>
    </tr>

</table>

<p>
If you <a href="../Analysis/GraphMetrics.htm">calculate group metrics</a>, a <a name="GroupEdgesWorksheet">Group Edges worksheet</a> gets added to the workbook.  This worksheet lists the number of edges within each group and the number of edges between group pairs.
