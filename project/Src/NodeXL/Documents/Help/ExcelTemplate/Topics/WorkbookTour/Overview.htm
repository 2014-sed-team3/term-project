<p>
When you open the NodeXL Excel Template from the Windows Start Menu, Excel creates a new workbook from the template and opens the workbook.  This <span class="Definition">NodeXL workbook</span> differs from a standard Excel workbook in that it contains multiple worksheets that have been customized for network graph data, a custom <span class="Definition">Graph Pane</span> used to display the network graph, and a custom NodeXL tab in the Excel Ribbon that contains commands specific to NodeXL.
</p>

<p>
These features appear only in NodeXL workbooks, and they are removed entirely from Excel when you close the NodeXL workbook.<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p>
The following diagram shows the <a href="Worksheets.htm">NodeXL worksheets</a>, the <a href="GraphPane.htm">Graph Pane</a> and the <a href="Ribbon.htm">NodeXL tab</a> in the Excel Ribbon.

<span class="Footnote">
It's the transient nature of these features that makes the NodeXL Excel Template (and any Excel template, in fact) different from an <a name="AddIn" target="_blank" href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/enable-or-disable-add-ins-in-office-programs-HA010034127.aspx">Excel add-in</a>, which is a set of features that are available at all times, from any Excel workbook.  NodeXL is <i>not</i> an Excel add-in.
