<p>
NodeXL's <a href="../WorkbookTour/GraphPane.htm">Graph Pane</a> usually shows you the entire graph.  If the graph is simple, viewing it in its entirety may be exactly what you want.  But if the graph is more complex, you might want to <a href="Zoom.htm">zoom in</a> to examine specific regions more closely.
</p>

<p>
NodeXL lets you zoom into and <a href="Move.htm">move around</a> the graph using several techniques.  You can also <a href="Scale.htm">scale</a> the graph, which shrinks all the graph's elements while keeping them in the same place.
