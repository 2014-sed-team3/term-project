<p>
You can <i>scale</i> the graph in the <a href="../WorkbookTour/GraphPane.htm">Graph Pane</a>, which shrinks all the graph's vertices, edges and labels while keeping them in the same place.  This can be useful with a graph that has many vertices, where reducing the scale can decrease the amount of vertex overlap and make it easier to make sense of the graph.
</p>

<div class="HowToTitle">
To scale the graph:
</div>

<ol>

    <li class="HowToItem">
    Drag the Scale slider at the top of the Graph Pane's toolbar.
    </li>

</ol>

<p>
If the Graph Pane is too narrow, the Scale slider won't be visible.  In this case, you can either widen the Graph Pane until the Scale slider appears, or click the down-arrow at the right edge of the Graph Pane's toolbar to make the Scale slider appear in a pop-up window.
