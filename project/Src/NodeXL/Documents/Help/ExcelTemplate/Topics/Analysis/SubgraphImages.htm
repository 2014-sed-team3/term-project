<div class="PageCaption">Creating Subgraph Images</div>

<p>
NodeXL will create an image of a <span class="Definition">subgraph</span> for each of the graph's vertices.  A vertex's subgraph consists of the vertex, its incident edges, and optionally its adjacent vertices, <i>their</i> incident edges, and so on, out to a specified level.  Here is a sample 1.5-level subgraph image:
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 10em;">
    <img src="../../Images/SubgraphImage.png" />
</div>

<p>
Note that the complete graph had many more vertices and edges than are shown here.  All the other vertices and edges were removed to create the vertex's subgraph image.
</p>

<p>
The subgraph images can be saved as files in a specified folder or as thumbnails inserted into the <a href="../WorkbookTour/Worksheets.htm">Vertices worksheet</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you save the subgraph images in a folder, each image file is named after the vertex.  The JPEG image file for a vertex named "Vertex 123" will be "Vertex 123.jpg," for example.  If a vertex name includes characters that aren't valid in file names, those characters get replaced with hexadecimal representations.  The JPEG image file for a vertex named "A\B" will be "A%5CB.jpg," for example.  (The backslash, which is not valid in file names, gets replaced with %5C, its hexadecimal representation.)
</p>

<p>
The "X", "Y" and "Locked?" columns on the <a href="../WorkbookTour/Worksheets.htm">Vertices worksheet</a> are ignored when the subgraph images are created.
