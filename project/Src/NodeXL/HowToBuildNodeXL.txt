This directory contains a Visual Studio 2013 solution that builds the NodeXL
system.  For a detailed list of projects in the solution, see .\ReadMe.txt.


Required Tools
--------------

1. Visual Studio 2013 Professional, Premium or Ultimate.

2. Excel 2013 or later.  (Or see "If You Don't Have Excel," below.)
   
3. If you want to build the help file for the NodeXL API (NodeXLApi.chm), you
   will need the NDoc documentation tool.  See
   .\Documents\Help\Api\HowToBuildNodeXLApiHelp.txt for details


How to Build This Solution
--------------------------

1. Download the latest source code from the NodeXL page on CodePlex.

2. If you downloaded the latest source code as a Zip file, unblock the Zip file
   (http://www.ehow.com/how_6967297_unblock-zip-files.html) and unzip it into
   any folder.

2. Open NodeXL\NodeXL.sln in Visual Studio 2013.

3. Run Build | Rebuild Solution.


If You Don't Have Excel
-----------------------

The solution contains several projects that will not build if Excel 2013 or
later is not installed on your development machine.  They are all related to
Excel and are not required if you are not developing for Excel.

To fix the build problems on development machines that do not have Excel,
remove the following projects from the solution.  You can do this by right-
clicking each project in Solution Explorer and selecting Remove.

    * All projects whose names start with "ExcelTemplate" 

    * GraphDataProviders

    * GraphMLFileProcessor

    * NetworkServer

    * TestGraphDataProviders

    * UnitTests
